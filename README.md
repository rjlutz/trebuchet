That link is dead.

27 Jan 2024: I had to update things to work. PBox2D is no longer available. I was able to load the library from Daniel Shiffman at https://github.com/shiffman/Box2D-for-Processing into my ~/Documents/Processing/libraries to get things to work.
Also needed to change references from PBox2D to PBox2DProcessing. Alive again!
